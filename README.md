# video-game-hacks
## Purpose
This is just a repo used for publishing/archiving my past work on hacking video games. The codes work, but there is no guarantee it won't be patched. A lot of work published here will be for games that are already shutdown or are no longer popular for obvious reasons. Sometimes there will be more instructions/readme available to explain what something does.
## Games
### SD Gundam Capsule Fighers Online (SDGO)
#### Capabilities
1. Full map vac for mission stages
2. Infinite ammo/booster/one-hit KO
3. Automate unit movement using built-in scripting engine's bot AI
4. Complete M16 Taozi mission in the fastest time possible without triggering disconnect by waiting for the in-game timer
5. 100% configurable using AI_Config.txt
6. Injects loader into game files to allow loading external modules to easily test new code changes
## TO-DO
1. Locate other SDGO related hacks such as removing all walls from map files to allow for full map wallhack
2. Describe thought process and concept used for exploiting past video games where I no longer have any data for
